# Lime-or-Lemon

This is the repository for a simple Web Application called "lime-or-lemon.com".

## Functionality

The entire web application is built around an image of a citrus fruit in the center of the screen.

Below the image are two push buttons:

- LIME
- LEMON

If the user selects the option that matches the picture, the application prints an encouraging message, including:
- Congratulations!
- Nailed it!
- Acceptable!

If the user selects the incorrect option, one of the following messages is displayed:
- Unacceptable!
- Incorrect.
- You need more practice.

After a few seconds, the message disappears, and the screen resets with a new image

## Project structure

- Image assets of lemons and limes are stored under res/lemon and res/lime, respectively.

## Workflow

- Commit completed changes to git by default.
